# journal_title_abbreviations
Journal title abbreviations file to be used with pandoc-citeproc

I did not find such a file when I was trying to compile a manuscript for a journal that reqires abbreviations in references. Therefore, I made one for this manuscript. Therefore, the current file only includes ecological journals.

However, it definitely can and should be expanded.
